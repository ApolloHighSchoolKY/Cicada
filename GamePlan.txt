Battle Royale Game Ideas:
Aesthetic/theme: Cyberpunk
Predominant colors: 
	black
	Grey
	Neon lights/signs

“Storm” mechanic- “Random” area sweep: military drones swarm area/auto-turrets spawn(extremely high DPS), area gated off after all “resistance” cleared

Arena concepts:
	Arena 1: metropolis cityscape(ex. Blade Runner/Ghost in the Shell)
	Arena 2: undercity slums
	Arena 3: megapolis
	Arena 4: futuristic dystopian military compound
	Arena 5: Randomly generated city scape
		Unique in that the map is generated at game start
		Never have to play same map again

Armor aesthetic:
	“Techwear”
	Trench coats
	Parkas
	Extra pockets/zippers on everything
	“Tacticool”
	Bionic upgrades
Shielding:
	Acts as a pseudo health bar
	Most damage is directed at shield first
Types:
	Low tier- Kinetic shield(only stops bullets/melee)
	Mid  tier- energy shield (also stops energy burst)
	High tier- better energy shield (stops all non piercing attacks)

Weapons aesthetic: futuristic guns/energy weapons
	low tier- “slug thrower”(bullets)
		Manual reload
	Mid tier- energy burst guns (replaces bullets with plasma)
		Gun overheats
		Eventually has to reload
	High tier- continuous fire laser
		Never has to be reloaded
		Still capable of overheating
	“Legendary” tier
		Unique items
		No more than one of each per game round
			Ex. If legendary A drops, no more of them will, but legendary B could still drop
		Stronger than normal weapons
		Doesn't necessarily follow the tier damage type rule(laser>burst>bullet)

Weapon classes: Low/Mid/High tier weapons randomly generated (Borderlands)
	Pistol
	Assault rifle
	Rifle
	Shotgun
	Sniper
	Rocket Launcher

Weapons characteristics:
	Bullets
		Neutral damage to flesh
		Decreased damage to shield
		Decreased damage to robotics
	Energy burst
		Increased damage to shields
		Neutral to flesh
		Causes dot to flesh
		Neutral to robotics
	Continuous beam
		Damage increases the longer the target has be consecutively hit by beam
		Gun stops firing/target moves out of beam, damage resets
		DoT to flesh
	Grenades:
		Frag grenade
		Sticky grenade
		DoT field

Character design:
	Character customization
	Basic classes
		“Hacker”
			Can hijack deactivate turrets/abandoned military supplies
			Open locked doors
		Stealth
			Self explanatory
		DPS
			Self explanatory
		Tank
			Self explanatory

Class powers: neat abilities based on you class, level up by defeating enemies
	Stealth: active camo(invisible)
		Increased duration based on level
	“Hacker”: Hijack enemy mobs, open locked doors
		High level “hacks” faster
	DPS: Temporary increases in DPS
		Increased DPS buff/duration based on level
	Tank: heal
		Amount based on level
		Higher level recovers more health quickly

Gimmick game type: battle royale + “Zombies” game type.
	Zones never get gated off. 
	Instead, zone is swarmed with respawning killable AI enemies(military mechs/drones, auto-turrets). 
	Enemies start with low dps/HP, increases as time goes on. 
	Eventually forces players into central zone
	Game ends when all players dead. 
	Winner is player with most points
	Points awarded based off of order of elimination, and kills(other players and AI)
